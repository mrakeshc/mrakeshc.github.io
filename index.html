                    <p>I am a research scientist on the Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence (AI-CoE) team at Rockwell Automation in Austin, TX.</p>
                    <p>My research at Rockwell Automation focuses on developing and deploying robust, end-to-end Computer Vision and Multimodal AI solutions for industrial automation environments. This involves designing closed-loop machine vision AI solutions that accommodate AI-driven data labeling, model training, performance monitoring, and analytics.</p>
                    <p>Before joining the AI-CoE, I was a graduate research assistant in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan (U of M), advised by Prof. Hun-Seok Kim. My research concentrated on developing novel compression techniques for various modalities, including point clouds, video, and images.</p>
                    <p>Prior to my graduate studies at U of M, I received my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Tirupati, India.</p>
